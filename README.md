# The Violet interpreter

Violet is a command interpreter.
Its main intended feature is a syntax close to plain English.
At the moment, Violet is just starting out and therefore no specific functionality is planned. Once the very basic alpha-version is ready, a user is going to be able to add new commands on their own and essentially make whatever they want out of Violet.

## Some possible features:

- Taking notes;
- Search mechanism for those notes;
- Arithmetic operations with time.

### IMPORTANT
This project has just started, therefore nothing is ready yet. There is close to nothing here, and everything that's already here is subject to change.
If you'd like to know how Violet's doing, please take a look at the [0.2.0 milestone](https://github.com/Oleksii-Kshenskyi/violet/milestone/1), currently this is what's being worked on.
